# SuitsMe

SuitsMe was built for the Alibaba Global E-commerce Challenge (GEC) 2024. It is a personalisation tool built to reduce buyer's remorse from purchasing fashion products that consumers eventually realise, doesn't suit them. SuitsMe allows consumers to perform a colour analysis to know which colours suits them best and recommends them fashion products (clothes, shoes, and accessories) in those colours.
