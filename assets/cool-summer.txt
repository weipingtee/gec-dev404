For the Cool Summer palette, choose light, breathable fabrics like linen, cotton, and soft jersey to enhance the gentle, muted colors. Flowing materials such as chiffon and silk will add a touch of serenity and softness to your wardrobe. Silver or white gold jewelry complements these tones beautifully, with delicate pieces featuring pale gemstones like pearls, moonstones, or rose quartz. Minimalist and refined designs in your accessories will align perfectly with the subtle and graceful aesthetic of Cool Summer.
